12	Anarchism	2008-12-30 06:23:05	Anarchism (sometimes referred to as libertarianism, though that term sometimes has other meanings as well) is a political philosophy encompassing theories and attitudes which support the elimination of all forms of compulsory government. The term anarchism derives from the Greek ἀναρχος, anarchos, meaning "without rulers", from the prefix ἀν- (an-, "without") + ἄρχή (archê, "sovereignty, realm, magistracy") + -ισμός (-ismos, from a stem -ιζειν, -izein). It is defined by The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics as "the view that society can and should be organized without a coercive state."
